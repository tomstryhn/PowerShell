# PowerShell
This is a collection of PowerShell scripts for various tasks, most of them are made based on a need or task. Some are more reusable than others, but I will try and keep them updated. Some of them are just parts needed for others scripts I use either related to my work or when I'm trying new stuff in my test-environments. So stuff like the `New-DummyURAGPO`, don't really make that much sense, but it comes in handy when deploying or updating 250 GPO's for an entire Active Directory. :) But feel free to reach out on LinkedIn or other SoMe.
